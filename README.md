Simple, short and sweet  beginners friendly C language programs 

“That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.” 
― Larry Niven

These program are written in codeblocks ide for windows. These programs are not very sophisticated as these are beginners friendly and have many bugs. Anyone who is new to c language can practice these examples. 

- Only programs written in c language will be merged.
- Beautify/Format your code before making a PR. Poorly stuctured code with inconsistent spacing and bad variable name will not be merged. 
- Use this tool to beautify your code : https://codebeautify.org/c-formatter-beautifier
- Make sure your program works after beautifying it.
- #include< stdio.h > is wrong and you must remove whitespaces. #include<stdio.h> is correct.
- Please check your spellings before making a PR
- Comment code properly.
